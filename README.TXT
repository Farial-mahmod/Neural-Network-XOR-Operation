Target: To develop a neural network that can predict the probability of an XOR-operation's result using JavaScript.

Requirements: 
(1)npm
(2) BrainJS library

In this program, a neural net is given the training data of XOR-operation, gets trained and finally predicts the output of XOR-operation quite successfully.

You may test this program in any browser that has JavaScript-enabled.
